# Automated-Slug-detection-system-for-Water-tanks
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop a microcontroller based prototype which alert the user 
to clean the water tank as the sludge level is more.


This prototype automates sludge level monitoring in water tanks using an ultrasonic sensor. It alerts users via LED or buzzer when sludge exceeds a threshold.
It ensures timely maintenance, improved water quality, and reduced costs.
